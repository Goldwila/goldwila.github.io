                  Goldwila is a Minecraft survival village where every subscriber gets their own house.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  The idea is simple: what if every person who subscribed didn't just become a number,
                  but a neighbor?
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  Each house is built by hand in survival mode. No creative mode. Every structure
                  represents someone who decided to be part of this community.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  This isn't about fancy builds or massive projects. It's about creating something
                  together. Your house becomes part of the village's story.
                </p>

                <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl">How It Works</h2>

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  When you subscribe, your house gets built and added to the village.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  Claim your house, give it a name, and explore the village in 3D right here on the
                  website.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  Join our Discord to meet the people whose houses are right next to yours. You're not
                  just a viewerâ€”you're part of it.
